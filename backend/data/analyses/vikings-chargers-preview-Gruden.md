## 🏁 Opening Thoughts

> “Okay, we got a big game Thursday night — the 3-and-3 Minnesota Vikings visiting the 4-and-3 Los Angeles Chargers.  
> Both these teams are banged up, both are frustrated, and both need this one bad.”

Gruden opens by emphasizing how unpredictable Thursday night games can be —  
short rest, travel issues, and tired bodies make for “the great equalizer.”

## ⚙️ Team Overview

### Chargers
The Chargers started the season **3-0**, looking like contenders,  
but they’ve dropped **three of their last four**, including a 38-24 loss to the Colts where they were “dominated at home.”

Gruden points out that quarterback **Justin Herbert** hasn’t been bad —  
but his protection has collapsed.  
> “You lose Joe Alt at tackle, you lose a couple linemen, that’s tough. You can’t throw if you’re on your back.”

### Vikings
The Vikings, meanwhile, are coming off a **bye-week loss to the Eagles**.  
Jaylen Hurts “lit them up” for over **325 yards passing**, and their secondary “looked lost.”

Gruden says the Vikings’ offensive line is also hurting:  
> “How the hell do you lose all your linemen? That’s like showing up to a barbeque without charcoal.”

## 🏥 Injury Report

### Los Angeles Chargers
- **Joe Alt (LT)** — out, knee  
- **Khalil Mack (EDGE)** — elbow, questionable  
- **Andrew Van Ginkel (LB)** — neck, limited  
- **Austin Ekeler (RB)** — shoulder, expected to play limited snaps  

> “They’re missing pieces everywhere. That defense has no rest, and Herbert’s been running for his life.”

### Minnesota Vikings
- **Brian O’Neal (RT)** — calf, doubtful  
- **Aaron Jones (RB)** — hamstring, questionable  
- **Multiple offensive linemen** — out or limited  

Gruden notes that **Brian Flores’ defense** has been “fighting their tails off” despite injuries,  
but their offense is inconsistent.

## 🧠 Key Matchups

### 1. Herbert vs Flores Blitz
The Vikings blitz on nearly **40 % of snaps**, second-most in the league.  
Gruden expects Herbert to answer with **screens, bubbles, and quick game**.

> “Herbert’s gonna get the ball out fast. You can’t hold it with that blitz coming.”

He predicts a heavy dose of **Austin Ekeler** and **Keenan Allen** in the short passing game.

---

### 2. Wentz vs Chargers Secondary
Gruden mentions **Carson Wentz** starting again for Minnesota:  
> “You never know with Wentz — he’ll make one throw that makes you say ‘wow’ and one that makes you cry.”  

He expects Wentz to take shots downfield to **Justin Jefferson** early:  
> “They’ll go deep on 1st and 10 just to test these corners.”

---

### 3. Vikings’ Run Game vs Chargers’ Front
The Vikings average only **103.8 rush yards per game**,  
while the Chargers give up **117.7 yards per game** on the ground.

> “Somebody’s gonna win the line tonight. You gotta run to win Thursday nights.”

   “Don’t get cute — Thursday nights are for power football.”
